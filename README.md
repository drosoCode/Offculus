# Offculus
Scripts to create offline installer for Oculus Rift

## Creation
 - Install Oculus Software, login and configure your headset (you need a functionnal installation for the creation of the installer)
 - Download this project and execute backup.bat (this will backup the Oculus Software and your user and headset data)
 - The installer is ready (you can copy the whole folder to a safe place)

## Usage
 - To use the offline installer, execute the install.bat (this will install the oculus software, drivers and services and will block communication with facebook servers)
 - By default the OVRService startup is set to manual, you can use the ovr.bat file to easily start and stop it
